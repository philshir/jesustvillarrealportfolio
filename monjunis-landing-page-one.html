           <p>Classic Italian</p>
       <p>Italian cuisine is well known for its bold flavors and abundant use of vegetables, pastas and meats. Italian restaurants are likely to offer a variety of delicious pizza pies and fresh toppings, as well as noodles like spaghetti, ziti, fettuccine, lasagna, gnocchi, macaroni, orzo, ravioli and rigatoni. When noodles are combined with bountiful sauces, vegetables and meats, what results are popular dishes like carbonara, linguine with clam sauce, chicken cacciatore, spaghetti with meatballs and much, much more.</p>

       <div><p>Louisiana inspired</p>
        <p>Nobody visits Louisiana on any sort of diet — unless it’s a po’ boy diet or a beignet diet, or really an anything-spicy diet. This is a state that knows no boundaries when it comes to rich, deep flavors. Whether you’re driving through Cajun country hankering for some roadside cracklins or spending a Friday afternoon at a neighborhood fish fry, these are the the must-eat-while-in-Louisiana list</p></div>
